<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>This program is meant to allow you to elect to remove all amazon listings from a typical google search. It can't yet remove the results that show up in the "images" section of the main search page, but it gets all the rest of them. To use it, feel free to download these files and install the chrome extension.  
If you pin the extension to your extensions bar, you will be able to see its status as an "on" or "off" badge, and you can activate or deactivate it at will by clicking on it. It should remain active across tabs, but it may take a moment to remove all amazon listings if you change tabs.  
If you have no idea how to do anything in this brief description, please see below for a much more detailed set of instructions on how to install and activate this chrome extension.</p>
